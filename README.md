## Alarm O'clock

### Overview

This Python script creates a countdown timer that you can set to alert you after a specified amount of time. It uses your computer's speaker to play an alarm sound when the countdown reaches zero.

### How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the script file (`countdown_timer.py`) from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repository-link).

2. **Running the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `countdown_timer.py` is located.
   - Type `python countdown_timer.py` and press Enter to start the program.

3. **Setting the Timer:**
   - The script will prompt you to enter how many minutes and seconds you want to wait.
   - Enter the desired values and press Enter.

4. **Countdown and Alert:**
   - The script will display a countdown timer in the format MM:SS on the screen.
   - When the countdown reaches zero, your computer will play an alarm sound to notify you.

5. **Repeat the Timer:**
   - After the alarm sounds, the script will ask you again how long to wait.
   - You can set a new timer by entering new values.

### Example
